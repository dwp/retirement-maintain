  <li>Taken out alternative contact format hint text - agents know what this is</li>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-s">Scenario</h2>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>Paper claims come through as a 'task'</li>
  <li>Paper claims tab used to complete a partially complete claim</li>
  <li>Journey to test the functionality of an agent completing a full claim (as far as they can) with missing information</li>
  <li>Includes coming back to a partially completed claim to enter info</li>
  <li>Agent has ability to choose whether the claim can be complete on GET or not</li>

</ul>
<!-- 
<h2 class="govuk-heading-s">Business requirements
</h2>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>When a correspondence comes in (proof of address) agent creates a record for the claim and puts a note in CAM to help signify that a claim was being handled in GySP </li>
  <li>Agent needs to have the ability to choose whether a claim can be processed on GET, reasons for this are: 
    <br>- if the scanned in form is illegible 
    <br>- an old rules BR1
    <br>- signed by a PAB or a CAB
    <br>- requesting alternative contact formats
  </li>
</ul> -->
<!-- <h2 class="govuk-heading-s">Research notes</h2>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>Usability tested very well</li>
  <li>Some agents purposely missed out the 'other names' field because it's what they would do now</li>
