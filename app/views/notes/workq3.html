<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Scenario</h3>

<p class="govuk-body">

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>Agents only see one task at a time - the next highest priority as determined by the back end  </li>

    <li>New navigation design allowing agent to go between the task they’re in, to changes and enquiries or new claims journeys
    </li>
    <li>Pattern in this scenario allows an agent to confirm they’ve completed a manual task
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Business requirements</h3>

<p class="govuk-body">

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>Agents should only be able to work on one task at a time  </li>

    <li>Agent needs to see what the task is before continuing into it to action it
    </li>
    <li>There needs to be a way of ending the task once complete so that it doesn’t appear back in the queue    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Research notes</h3>

<p class="govuk-body">

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>Agents found the task straightforward and simple to complete</li>

    <li>Some agents said that agents do cherry pick tasks if they see a list of them, this way they can't do that
    </li>
    <li>Some agents said a list of tasks is often stressful to see, this design takes away that stress</li>
  </ul>
